      <description>Last night I started working on Lilly&amp;rsquo;s 365 and very quickly ran into a few problems. Most were simple quirks of site5 fixed by getting the permissions right. The thing that kept bugging me was Phlickr, and more specifically its use of cURL.
Phlickr is an open source PHP5 based API kit used to access the Flickr API. It uses the REST method which requires that some actions are POSTs. The cURL functions in PHP can happily handle this but for some reason they were failing every time&amp;hellip; &amp;ldquo;Failed to open/read local data from file/application&amp;rdquo; (Error 26).</description>

      <description>New to PHP 5.3.0 will be late static bindings. Currently you can use the self keyword in PHP to access static methods of the current class, the new static keyword allows you to access static methods through the inheritance tree. This example from the PHP website explains best&amp;hellip;
Code &amp;lt;?php class A { public static function who() { echo __CLASS__; } public static function test() { static::who(); // Here comes Late Static Bindings  } } class B extends A { public static function who() { echo __CLASS__; } } A::test(); B::test(); ?</description>

      <title>CSS for Poker Players</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve just read an excellent explanation of CSS Specificity using a poker analogy and it just makes it so clear to hear it like that. The author covers everything in terms of the basic hands available in a game of poker. This can help explain some of the many mysteries of CSS!

 Some folks getting on board with CSS tend to get stuck on CSS specificity. The descriptions of which rules override other rules tend to make more sense to programmers than designers, since programmers are used to the concepts of inheritance and overriding properties.</description>
