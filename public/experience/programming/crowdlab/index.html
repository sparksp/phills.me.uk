    API Engineer &amp; Tech Team Lead
    at <a href="http://crowdlab.com">CrowdLab</a>
    <small>2013 &amp; 2014â€“2016</small>
  </h3>

  <p>Initially migrating the CrowdLab API from CodeIgniter (PHP) &amp; MySQL to Ruby on Rails &amp; PostgreSQL; designing and implementing new features from the API / Database point of view, while also considering the wider reaching effects of elements.  I facilitated the implementation and continued use of Scrum within CrowdLab.  I became an interface between the Market Research and the Technical teams.</p>

<p>My responsibilities gradually expanded from leading (in 2014) to managing (from late 2015) the development team at CrowdLab.  This change in role resulted in me managing the team&rsquo;s overall workload and ensuring that deadlines were met, conducting interviews with prospective team members, reviewing staff performance and recommending salary changes to the Managing Director.</p>
