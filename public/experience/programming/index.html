  <p>Initially migrating the CrowdLab API from CodeIgniter (PHP) &amp; MySQL to Ruby on Rails &amp; PostgreSQL; designing and implementing new features from the API / Database point of view, while also considering the wider reaching effects of elements.

This change in role resulted in me managing the team&rsquo;s overall workload and ensuring that deadlines were met, conducting interviews with prospective team members, reviewing staff performance and recommending salary changes to the Managing Director.</p>
