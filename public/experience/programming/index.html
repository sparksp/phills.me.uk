  <h2>Programming Experience</h2>
  <p>I have been involved in web development since arriving at university in 2003, I have worked with several programming languages and I have a working knowledge of Unix systems. I have most recently worked with Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL and Nginx. Before that I was working with PHP (Laravel Framework) and MySQL. I prefer to plan and build back end systems, allowing others to design and craft the front end.</p>

  <p>Initially migrating the CrowdLab API from CodeIgniter (PHP) &amp; MySQL to Ruby on Rails &amp; PostgreSQL; designing and implementing new features from the API / Database point of view, while also considering the wider reaching effects of elements.

<p>My responsibilities gradually expanded from leading (in 2014) to managing (from late 2015) the development team at CrowdLab.  This change in role resulted in me managing the team&rsquo;s overall workload and ensuring that deadlines were met, conducting interviews with prospective team members, reviewing staff performance and recommending salary changes to the Managing Director.</p>
