    <h2>CSS for Poker Players</h2>
    <p class="post-date">Saturday, 14 April 2007</p>
    <p>I&rsquo;ve just read an excellent explanation of <a href="http://iamacamera.org/default.aspx?section=design/css&amp;id=95">CSS Specificity using a poker analogy</a> and it just makes it so clear to hear it like that.  The author covers everything in terms of the basic hands available in a game of poker.  This can help explain some of the many mysteries of CSS!</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re not from the programming world and CSS seems a bit confusing, perhaps this analogy may help clear some concepts up. Think of CSS rules as poker hands. The best hand determines an element&rsquo;s style.</blockquote></p>
