      <description>Initially, I migrated the CrowdLab API from CodeIgniter (PHP) &amp;amp; MySQL to Ruby on Rails &amp;amp; PostgreSQL - re-engineering many of the features based on the company’s experiences of having run the system for a year.
One of the biggest improvements was enabling content additions and amends to be made by the client services team through a web interface. In the early versions of CrowdLab, such work was done by the development team.</description>

      <description>Womble was a new Scouting event in 2012. The website featured some basic information about the activities and an online group booking form. In subsequent years the event content was moved to WordPress to allow the organisers to quickly make updates, while the bookings site was redeveloped using Laravel. The event also had an active Facebook and Twitter presence from the start, with design elements shared across both where possible.</description>

      <description>High Adventure is an annual mountain exercise, taking place at a different, secret location each year.
I joined the team in 2012 to develop a website giving details of each upcoming event and holding a record of past events. I created the design, inspired by the Scout Association website, and customised it to suit the content. Finally, I populated the site before training other users to update information themselves.

      <description>Domino&amp;rsquo;s UK wanted to give away vouchers for every goal scored during Euro 2012. The first 1000 people to tap the &amp;ldquo;Goal!&amp;rdquo; button would win a voucher – &amp;pound;5 for the first goal, &amp;pound;10 for the second by the same player, and &amp;pound;20 for a hat-trick.
My role was to develop the server infrastructure to support the apps, including fetching the game data from a 3rd party, registering new users, serving game data to the apps, and correctly awarding vouchers for each goal.</description>

      <description>I built this app for Pantheon’s 2011 Annual Investor Meeting. The app was installed on strategically-placed iPads; it was used throughout the conference weekend to provide information to and gather feedback from attendees.
Features included:
 A 10 question survey A short feedback form A photo gallery downloaded from the web on launch A tabbed view of event information Two map screens with information points  The app was written in JavaScript using the Appcelerator Titanium mobile SDK.</description>

      <description>In 2010 I attended a workshop and conference in Athens to test the Empedia platform with a group of creative academics. During my visit, I worked with some non-technical people to build a guide and verify the platform with as many people as possible.</description>

      <description>A site for residents of Charnwood to find out about their house and local area. Data is mined from over ten different sources and presented to the user in a concise manner. Property-based information was presented in a collection of overview widgets, and a map was available to explore locative information across the borough. I refined My Charnwood over some iterations &amp;mdash; adding and improving functionality at each step. My Charnwood was so successful that we continued to build &amp;ldquo;My&amp;rdquo; services for two more councils.</description>
