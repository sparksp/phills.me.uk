      <p>Domino&rsquo;s UK wanted to give away vouchers for every goal scored during Euro 2012.  The first 1000 people to tap the &ldquo;Goal!&rdquo; button would win a voucher – &pound;5 for the first goal, &pound;10 for the second by the same player, and &pound;20 for a hat-trick.</p>

<p>My role was to develop the server infrastructure to support the apps, including fetching the game data from a 3rd party, registering new users, serving game data to the apps, and correctly awarding vouchers for each goal.</p>

<p>The biggest challenge for me was in handling the massive spikes of users all wanting to win vouchers as each goal was scored, without dropping or blocking any requests. I was required to think outside of the usual RDBMS box when allocating vouchers and aligning them with the winners.</p>
