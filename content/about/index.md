I have been climbing in some small way most of my life, whether the furniture at home, trees at the local park, taster sessions with scouts, or weeks away in the holidays.  Around 10 years ago I rediscovered climbing with some friends at University and this started my regular, independent climbing.

A year later I started to help with climbing and crate stacking at the local scout campsite and since then have worked hard to become a qualified climbing instructor and coach. My qualifications allow me to instruct top-rope climbing and abseiling indoors and at natural rock crags, and to teach lead climbing indoors, all with an air of coaching about it.  I am currently the [NICAS Course Director][nicas] at [The Tower Climbing Centre][tower] where I continue to develop my coaching skills, and I work for the [Peak Climbing School][peakclimbingschool] where I introduce groups to outdoor climbing and teach them the skills to become independent.  I deliver the new [Indoor Climbing Assistant][ica] scheme for [Mountain Training][mountain-training], run [Girlguiding Climbing and Abseiling Scheme][girlguiding-training] training, and assess [Artificial Climbing and Abseiling permits][scout-permits] for [The Scouts][thescouts].

I'm a trainee Rock Climbing Development Instructor and Climbing Development Coach, where I'm now building up a portfolio of experiences that will enable me to safely coach single pitch lead climbing skills outside.

I enjoy climbing in all forms, especially sport and trad climbing when the weather is good, and indoor sport climbing throughout the year.
