Activities are an integral part of Scouting, and what makes it so exciting for the young people involved.  The adventurous activity permit scheme is an internal assessment scheme designed to ensure that all those leading adventurous activities for young people within Scouting have the skills, experience and personal suitability to do so. Full details of [the permit scheme][permit-scheme] are available on The Scouts website.

### Training and assessment courses

I am authorised to run training and assessment of **artificial top rope** permits (including abseiling).  Courses are organised on demand and tailored to each individual/group's needs so please get in touch if you'd like to discuss one.  If you're looking for assessment there are a few things I'll ask you for:

* [Permit application form][adactpermit]
* Log of your experience (personal and instructional)
* You must have an appropriate full adult role
* Broadly, your availability to meet

### What are restrictive permits?

Any permit can be restricted to personalise it to the level you are at or wish your permit to be limited to. This allows you to lead the activity within certain parameters.

You can then gain further experience, which could lead to a less restrictive permit in future, should you wish to get one. This is rather than not allowing you any permit, and thus not giving you an opportunity to gain experience leading groups until you have the skills to gain an unrestricted permit.

### Is the permit scheme compatible with Mountain Training awards?

The permit scheme is solely for those operating in Scouting, and permits can be issued to restrict the activity to certain areas. [Mountain Training][mountain-training] awards apply across the UK.

Conversely, the possession of a Mountain Training award does not mean that a person is suitable to work with young people, hence the checks that need to be made by the responsible commissioner â€“ including the fact that we have certain activity-specific rules. We do, however, suggest that the training schemes offered by Mountain Training are good places to learn skills.

If you hold a relevant award from Mountain Training and have up to date logged experience, then no practical assessment is likely to be required as you have already shown competence in all of the skills required. You will still require a recommendation from an assessor for a Commissioner to grant you a permit.
