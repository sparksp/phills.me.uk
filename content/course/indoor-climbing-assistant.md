*This new scheme is currently being developed and will be launched in January 2019.  The information below is designed to give you an insight into what's coming and should not be considered definitive at this stage.*

The Indoor Climbing Assistant qualification is for those with competence in the basic skills of climbing who wish to assist qualiﬁed climbing instructors and coaches in the management of their sessions. Indoor Climbing Assistants are assessed as being competent in their role supporting qualiﬁed instructors and coaches but are not qualiﬁed to manage groups independently.

### Is it for me?

The prerequisites for registration are as follows:

* Be at least 16 years old.
* Have an interest in assisting qualified instructors on indoor climbing walls.

If the above applies to you, when registrations open in January 2019 you will be able to register for the scheme. This will give you access to DLOG (our digital logbook) where you can record your experience and keep track of your progress.

### Training and Assessment

The course involves one day (or potentially two evenings) of training and ongoing assessment in a supportive learning environment covering the following topics:

* Technical competence (equipment, belaying, personal skills and background knowledge)
* Management and decision making (managing participants under supervision, demonstrations and understanding your role)
* Teaching and learning skills
* The climbing environment (access, etiquette and ethics)

Prerequisites for attending the course are as follows:

* Experience in the basic skills (belaying, harness fitting, tying on).
* 5 indoor climbing sessions. (There is no personal climbing requirement, you can just belay, but it is useful to have experience of climbing.)
* Belayed on a minimum of 5 indoor climbing sessions.

After the course you will be given an assessment result of either Pass or Defer (not yet mastered basic skills).
