Initially, I migrated the CrowdLab API from CodeIgniter (PHP) &amp; MySQL to Ruby on Rails &amp; PostgreSQL - re-engineering many of the features based on the company's experiences of having run the system for a year.

One of the biggest improvements was enabling content additions and amends to be made by the client services team through a web interface.  In the early versions of CrowdLab, such work was done by the development team.

After the migration was complete, I designed and implemented new features from the API / Database point of view, and considered the wider reaching effects of features.

I also managed the cloud servers for the staging and production environments, working toward automating as many processes as possible with Ansible.
