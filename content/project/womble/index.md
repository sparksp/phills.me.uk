Womble was a new Scouting event in 2012. The website featured some basic information about the activities and an online group booking form. In subsequent years the event content was moved to WordPress to allow the organisers to quickly make updates, while the bookings site was redeveloped using Laravel. The event also had an active Facebook and Twitter presence from the start, with design elements shared across both where possible.
