A site for residents of Charnwood to find out about their house and local area.  Data is mined from over 10 different sources and presented to the user in a concise manner.  I developed My Charnwood over a number of iterations &mdash; adding and refining functionality at each step.  The project was eventually cloned for two more councils.
