A site for residents of Charnwood to find out about their house and local area. Data is mined from over ten different sources and presented to the user in a concise manner. I developed My Charnwood over some iterations &mdash; adding and refining functionality at each step. My Charnwood was so successful that we continued to build "My" services for two more councils.
