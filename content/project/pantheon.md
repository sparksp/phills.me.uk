I built this app for Pantheonâ€™s 2011 Annual Investor Meeting. The app was installed on strategically-placed iPads; it was used throughout the conference weekend to provide information to and gather feedback from attendees.

Features included:

- A 10 question survey
- A short feedback form
- A photo gallery downloaded from the web on launch
- A tabbed view of event information
- Two map screens with information points

The app was written in JavaScript using the Appcelerator Titanium mobile SDK.

This app is not available in the AppStore.
