High Adventure is an annual mountain exercise, taking place at a different, secret location each year.

I joined the team in 2012 to develop a website that provides lots of useful information for participants before the event and holds a record of past high adventures.

The event has a strong Facebook following that we are keen to maintain; we have also added Twitter to the pool, automatically getting posts from the Facebook page.

The design was inspired by the Scout Association website and customised to suit our needs.
