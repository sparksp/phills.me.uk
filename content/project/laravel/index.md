[Laravel](https://laravel.com/) is "a clean and classy framework for PHP web development."

I was an active member of the community where I reviewed commits, submitted patches, moderated the forums, and discussed code topics with other users.

I developed and maintained an [IRC bot written in Laravel](https://github.com/sparksp/laravel-ircbot), that provided help to users in the main Laravel IRC channels, along with a number of bundles for Laravel 3.

I was a keynote speaker at [Laracon 2013](https://laracon.eu/2013/), deivering a talk about [Software Design Patterns in Laravel 4](https://www.slideshare.net/sparksphill/software-design-patterns-in-laravel-by-phill-sparks).
