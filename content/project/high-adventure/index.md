High Adventure is an annual mountain exercise, taking place at a different, secret location each year.

I joined the team in 2012 to develop a website giving details of each upcoming event and holding a record of past events.  I created the design, inspired by the Scout Association website, and customised it to suit the content.  Finally, I populated the site before training other users to update information themselves.
