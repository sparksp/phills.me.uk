I've just read an excellent explanation of [CSS Specificity using a poker analogy](http://iamacamera.org/default.aspx?section=design/css&id=95) and it just makes it so clear to hear it like that.  The author covers everything in terms of the basic hands available in a game of poker.  This can help explain some of the many mysteries of CSS!
