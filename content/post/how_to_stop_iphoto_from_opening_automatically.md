I've stopped using iPhoto recently in favour of [Flickr](http://flic.kr) but every time I plug in a camera, or something that looks like it could be a camera, iPhoto opens.  A quick hunt around the Internet and I found the solution...

1. Open "Image Capture"
2. In "Preferences", choose "No application" for the option "When a camera is connected, open"
3. That's it!  You can quit Image Capture now.

How easy was that?!
