In 2009 I started to help with climbing and crate stacking sessions at my local Scout campsite and since then have worked hard to become a qualified climbing instructor and coach.  I am now the NICAS Course Director at The Tower Climbing Centre where I continue to develop my instructor training and client coaching skills.
