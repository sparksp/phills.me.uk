In 2009 I started to help with climbing sessions at the local scout campsite and since then have worked hard to become a qualified Scout and Guide climbing instructor. In 2012 I gained the Climbing Wall Award that enables me to take groups climbing indoor, in 2013 I completed the Single Pitch Award that allows me to take groups out on rock, and in 2015 I completed the Climbing Wall Leading Award that allows me to coach lead climbing indoors. Now I continue working toward the new [Coaching Scheme][Coaching Scheme] to develop my coaching abilities further. In 2013 I also attended two of the BMC [FUNdamentals of Climbing][FUNdas] workshops and I look forward to attending the third in the future.

I lead and supervise groups climbing and abseiling on artificial walls &amp; towers, and on natural rock.
