From 2009 &ndash; 2012 I was Assistant Scout Leader and then Scout Leader for the 1st Sapcote Scouts. During this time I completed my leader training and was awarded the [Wood Badge][Wood Badge]. I helped to grow the section from a low of 2 scouts up to 9 scouts at the start of 2012. The section continues to grow under new leadership.
