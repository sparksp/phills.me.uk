After 18 months as a County Scout Network Leader, I took the step up to Commissioner where I manage the other Network Leaders and support the Network Chairman. I attend County Scout Executive meetings and work to grow and develop Scout Network in the county by creating new opportunities for young people to engage with Scout Network.
