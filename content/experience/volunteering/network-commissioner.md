After 18 months as a Network Leader, I took the step up to Commissioner where I managed the other Network Leaders and supported the Network Chairman. I attended County Scout Executive meetings and worked to grow and develop Scout Network in the county by creating new opportunities for young people to engage with Scout Network.
