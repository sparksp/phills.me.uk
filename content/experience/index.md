## Climbing & Ropes Experience

In 2009 I started to help with climbing and crate stacking sessions at my local Scout campsite and since then have worked hard to become a qualified climbing instructor and coach. I am now a [Freelance Climbing Coach](#freelance-climbing-coach-in-the-midlands), provide the [Indoor Climbing Assistant qualification](#course-provider-for-mountain-training), and [inspect Activity PPE](#freelance-ppe-inspector-in-the-midlands). I offer my experience to the Scouts in Leicestershire, providing training and permit assessments to climbing instructors. I continue to improve my coaching and instructor training experience so that I may be able to offer more (and better) instructor training courses in the future.
