Initially migrating the CrowdLab API from CodeIgniter (PHP) &amp; MySQL to Ruby on Rails &amp; PostgreSQL; designing and implementing new features from the API / Database point of view, but also considering the wider reaching affects of features; facilitating the implementation and continued use of Scrum within CrowdLab; being an interface between the Market Research and the Technical teams.

My responsibilities gradually expanded from leading (in 2014) to managing (from late 2015) the development team at CrowdLab.  These responsibilities included allocating work, conducting interviews with prospective team members, reviewing performance, and recommending salary changes to the Managing Director.
