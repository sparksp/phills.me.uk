Initially migrating the CrowdLab API from CodeIgniter (PHP) & MySQL to Ruby on Rails & PostgreSQL; designing and implementing new features from the API / Database point of view, while also considering the wider reaching effects of elements.  I facilitated the implementation and continued use of Scrum within CrowdLab.  I became an interface between the Market Research and the Technical teams.

My responsibilities gradually expanded from leading (in 2014) to managing (from late 2015) the development team at CrowdLab.  This change in role resulted in me managing the team's overall workload and ensuring that deadlines were met, conducting interviews with prospective team members, reviewing staff performance and recommending salary changes to the Managing Director.
