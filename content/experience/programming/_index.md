I have been involved in web development since arriving at university in 2003, I have worked with several programming languages and I have a working knowledge of Unix systems. I have most recently worked with Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL and Nginx. Before that I was working with PHP (Laravel Framework) and MySQL. I prefer to plan and build back end systems, allowing others to design and craft the front end.
